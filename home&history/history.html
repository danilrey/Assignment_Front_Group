            SpongeBob SquarePants was created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. <br>
            In the 1980s, while teaching marine biology, Hillenburg developed an educational comic book called The Intertidal Zone, <br>
            which featured sea creatures to explain ocean life to his students. <br>
            One of the characters — a sponge — later inspired SpongeBob. <br>
            After studying animation, Hillenburg joined Nickelodeon, where he worked on the cartoon Rocko’s Modern Life. <br>
            In 1996, he began developing his own show about a cheerful sponge living under the sea. <br>
            The pilot episode aired in 1999, and the series quickly became one of Nickelodeon’s biggest successes. <br>
            Tom Kenny voiced the character of SpongeBob, while many other voice actors <br>
            (such as Bill Fagerbakke as Patrick Star and Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs) became iconic as well. <br>
            The series stood out for its surreal humor, colorful animation, <br>
            and unique blend of childlike innocence with comedy that also appealed to adults. <br>
            Over the years, SpongeBob SquarePants grew into a global cultural phenomenon, inspiring feature films, <br>
            stage shows, video games, and countless memes. <br>
            It remains one of the longest-running and most beloved animated series in television history.

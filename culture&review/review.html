        <h2>Opinion of critics on TV show</h2>

        <p>When "Spongebob Squarepants" first started, I was one of those who watched it religiously. I absolutely loved it, and thought it was the best animated show on Nickelodean. I loved the fact it was funny, creative and original. It was vibrantly animated, with lavish colouring and convincing character features. The theme tune, what can I say? Probably the catchiest theme tune out of the shows airing on Nicolodean now. The writing was witty, funny and even intelligent, and the characters were endearing, from Spongebob himself, cynical Squidward, Eugene H. Karbs and the hilarious Patrick. And the voice acting was well done. 
        <br>
        So why did I not give it a higher score? Like "Rugrats" and "The Simpsons" the newer episodes don't work. They aren't as funny or as creative in terms of written quality as the older episodes,relying too much on toilet humour, and the voice acting sometimes is lazy, Patrick in particular now seems bored and world weary now. And Spongebob, the voice is way too high. The episode ideas aren't as original or as well thought out, in fact they are rather predictable and unrealistic. The animation and the theme tune are pretty much the only things that make the newer episodes remotely watchable. All in all, I do really like this show, for the sense of fun and creativity it has, but I just wish the newer episodes weren't as tired. 7/10 Bethany Cox</p>
